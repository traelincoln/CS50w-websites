# CS50w-websites
Websites that I am creating while learning web programming with Python and Javascript 
I am taking this course CS50W with Havardx or Edx and for our first project 
We have to design 3 websites that look and function like the google search, google image search and advanced google search web pages
This project folder named search has the html and css files as well as the images that i used to create those pages
So far i have only used HTML and Css to implement the websites but i am planning to improve the design of the code by using some bootstrap and may some Sass as well
Wish me luck!

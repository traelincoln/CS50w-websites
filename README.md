# CS50w-website

This is the repository for the mock of google's search homepage.
I built this site as project 0 for course cs50w web-development with python and javascript which I am doing online with Havardx on Edx. 

The site is deployed here via github pages, and you can check out the demonstration on youtube.

The site consists of three pages the Google search, Google Images and Google advanced search. Each one tries to mimick each one of those google pages.

I used html, css and just a single line of javascript in image-search.html to implement this site.  

The files for the site are in the <code>[docs folder](docs/)</code> and they are arranged as so
- css/ #this folder contains the single stylesheet i used for all three pahes 
  - google-search.css
- images/ #this folder contains the three images used for the site
  - google-logo.png  
  - google-logo2-png
  - search-icon.png
- advanced-search.html
- image-search.html
- index.html
